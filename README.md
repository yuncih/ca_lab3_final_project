# Construct a single-cycle RISC-V CPU with Chisel

## Development Objectives

Our goal is to create a RISC-V CPU that prioritizes simplicity while assuming a foundational understanding of digital circuits and the C programming language among its readers. The CPU should strike a balance between simplicity and sophistication, and we intend to maximize its functionality. This project encompasses the following key aspects, which will be prominently featured in the technical report:
* Implementation in Chisel.
* RV32I instruction set support.
* Execution of programs compiled from the C programming language.
